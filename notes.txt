This code was created 

  // Testbench uses a 25 MHz clock
  // Want to interface to 115200 baud UART
  // 25000000 / 115200 = 217 Clocks Per Bit.
  parameter c_CLOCK_PERIOD_NS = 40;
  Testing at 100 MHz appears okay
    Using MyHDL to create uart_rx.v with uart_rx.py
    & uart_tx.v with uart_tx.py
